# Unity assignment 4: Augmented reality with AR Foundation

- AR Foundation is a cross-platform AR SDK for Unity, Android & iOS support
- easier to get started with when comparing to native SDKs
- this assignment gives you a glance to the world of AR software development

## Instructions

1. Study  [setting up of the AR Foundation in Unity](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/setting-up-ar-foundation)
1. Start developing your AR application by following [this tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/instantiating-ar-models-into-a-virtual-scene)
1. Test building/running example app in a mobile device (Android)
    - make sure you have [Android SDK Tools & JDK included in Unity modules installation](../assets/unity-android-sdk-install.png)
    - set _Company Name_ and _Product Name_ to create a unique _Package Name_ (app identifier)
    - set _minimun API level_ according to the age of the target devices you want to support (min. 24 for ARCore use)
1. Develop further, some ideas:
   - use your own 3D models
   - add [image tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdeuA0FITS0), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9j3MD7gS5Y)
   - user interactions
   - just try & play with your ideas (can be just a technology demo, not a potentially shippable product)

### Some resources

- [AR Foundation manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.1/manual/index.html)
- [Other getting started tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/14808876-ar-foundation-in-unity-getting-started)

## Grading (max. 3 points)

- Getting started tutorial done, running in device: 1 p.
- App running in a mobile device and new features designed and implemented by yourself: 2 p.  

## Guidelines for all Unity tasks

- 2-step returning:
  1. return your Unity project to oma: Create a zip-file of your project folder containing **only** the _Assets_ and _ProjectSettings_ subfolders
  2. present your project "live" to teacher latest at next day after the deadline to get the points
- always list used references & sources in code comments or in a separate readme file
- grading when returning late: a week or less: -50 %, more: -70-100 %

## Optional assignment

For those who can't do the AR assignment because of not having the required hardware (supported mobile device or webcam) for testing it.

1. Write an essay of 3 pages max. (~1500 words) about the differences and usage of different AR technologies (ARKit, ARCore, Vuforia, AR Foundation...).
2. Return to Oma in **PDF** format (Unity assignmnent 4).
