# Unity assignment 1: Getting started

1. Create a scene containing (teacher's example, 1 point):
    - ground plane ([example image file](../assets/ground.png))
    - object controlled by user (horizontal movement, turning, jumping)
    - some other objects
2. Add more objects and features (1 point)
    - solid obstacles that prevent moving objects falling from the plane
    - add materials to all game objects
3. Add your own twist to the scene (something extra, use your imagination, 1 point), e.g:
    - goal for the player: what the player should do to finish the "game"
    - interactions with objects: what happens when player touches some other game object
    - VR support (check below)
4. BONUS: Try to add support for simple VR goggles (Google cardboard or similar)
    - simple movement without button controls (e.g. by panning/tilting the device/user's head)
    - add [VR headset support](./unity-vr-instructions.md)
    - if you have an access to any other VR equipment, feel free to try with those too

Grading 0-3 points.

## Guidelines for all Unity tasks

- 2-step returning:
  1. return your Unity project to oma: Create a zip-file of your project folder containing **only** the _Assets_ and _ProjectSettings_ subfolders
  2. present your project "live" to teacher latest at next day after the deadline to get the points
- always list used references & sources in code comments or in a separate readme file
- grading when returning late: a week or less: -50 %, more: -70-100 %
